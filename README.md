Write
=====

Write is a simple markdown based blogging engine built on Phalcon. Installation is simple, and no database is not
required. Simply upload the application to your web root, drop .md files into `/write/data/` and watch them
magically appear on your website.

Requirements
------------

1. PHP 5.3 or higher (5.4+ recommended)
1. Phalcon 1.2.x or higher
1. [Temporary] Apache Web Server (Other rewrite format will be investigated later)

Optional Components
-------------------

1. [Coming soon] APC or Memcache (for caching)

Installation
------------

1. Install [Phalcon](http://www.phalconphp.com/) if you don't already have it.
1. Upload `/write/` and `.htaccess` to your web root.
1. Make sure `/write/data/` and `/write/cache/` can be written into by your web server.
1. Upload .md files into `/write/data/` to start publishing content.
